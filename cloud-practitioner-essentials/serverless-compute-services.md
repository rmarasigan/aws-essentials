# Serverless Compute Services

### What is serverless computing?
**Serverless** is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers. Serverless differs from other cloud computing models in that the cloud provider is responsible for managing both the cloud infrastructure and the scaling of apps. Serverless apps are deployed in containers that automatically launch on demand when called.
