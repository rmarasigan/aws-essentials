# AWS Well-Architected Framework
The **Well-Architected Framework** helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud.

It is based on six pillars:
* Operational Excellence
* Security
* Reliability
* Performance Efficiency
* Cost Optimization
* Sustainability

## Operational Excellence
Run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processed and procedures
* Perform operations as code
* Annotate documentation
* Anticipate failure
* Refine operations procedures frequently
* Make frequent, small, reversible changes

## Security
Protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies
* Automate security best practices
* Apply security at all layers
* Protect data in transite and at rest

## Reliability
Test recovery procedures, scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automatically recover from failure
* Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
* Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
* Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues

## Performance Efficiency
Use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve
* Experiment more often
* Use serverless architectures
* Go global in minutes

## Cost Optimization
Run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point
* Adopt a consumption model
* Analyze and attribute expenditure
* Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership

## Sustainability
Addresses the long-term environmental, economic, and societal impact of your business activities
* Establish sustainability goals
* Maximize utilization
* Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
