## AWS Pricing Concepts
### Pay as you go
Pay only for the resources that you use without provisioning capacity in advance.

### Pay less when you reserve
Reduce costs by resrving capacity in services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS).

### Pay less with volume-based discounts
Receive savings through volume-based discounts as your usage increases.
