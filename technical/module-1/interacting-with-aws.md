# Interacting with AWS

Every action you make in AWS is an API call that is authenticated and authorized. In AWS, you can make API calls to services and resources through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS software development kits (SDKs).

## AWS Management Console
One way to manage cloud resources is through the web-based console, where you log in and choose the desired service. This can be the easiest way to create and manage resources when you first begin working with the cloud.

The **AWS Management Console** is a web application that comprises and refers to a broad collection of service consoles for managing AWS resources. When you first sign in, you see the console home page. The home page provides access to each service console and offers a single place to access the information you need to perform your AWS related tasks. It also lets you customize the Console Home experience by adding, removing, and rearranging widgets such as Recently visited, AWS Health, Trusted Advisor, and more.

## AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
The AWS CLI is a unified tool that you can use to manage AWS services. You can download and configure one tool that you can use to control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them with scripts. The AWS CLI is open-source, and installers are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

The AWS CLI v2 offers several new features including improved installers, new configuration options such as AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS SSO), and various interactive features.

With minimal configuration, the AWS CLI enables you to start running commands that implement functionality equivalent to that provided by the browser-based AWS Management Console from the command prompt in your terminal program:

* **Linux shells** – Use common shell programs such as bash, zsh, and tcsh to run commands in Linux or macOS.
* **Windows command line** – On Windows, run commands at the Windows command prompt or in PowerShell.
* **Remotely** – Run commands on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances through a remote terminal program such as PuTTY or SSH, or with AWS Systems Manager.

## AWS SDKs
API calls to AWS can also be performed by running code with programming languages. You can do this by using AWS software development kits (SDKs). SDKs are open source and maintained by AWS for the most popular programming languages, such as C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby.
